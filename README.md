🦺 Construction Safety Detection (YOLO)
📌 About the Project

This project is an AI-powered construction safety monitoring system that uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) to detect whether workers are wearing mandatory safety equipment such as helmets, vests, and other protective gear.

The model achieves 90%+ accuracy and is integrated with a Flask backend and a simple HTML frontend for visualization. To ensure easy deployment and portability, the entire application has been containerized using Docker.

🚀 Key Features

Detects if a worker is wearing or not wearing safety gear

Achieves 90%+ detection accuracy

Backend built with Flask

Simple HTML interface for user interaction

Dockerized deployment for consistency and scalability

🛠️ Tech Stack
